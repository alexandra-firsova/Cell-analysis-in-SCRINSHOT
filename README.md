[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17167876.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17167876)

The code performs analysis and clustering of SCRINSHOT-derived datasets optimised for 64 cell type marker genes. It was used for the publication:
Firsova AB, Marco Salas S, et al. Spatial single cell atlas reveals regional variations in healthy and diseased human lung. - Nat Comm 2025. 

Requirements: a csv or xlsx matrix containing columns of metadata and at least 15 genes with reads per cell number. See uploaded data file as an example.
